## Installed resources

Keep the working directory at the user's project. Resolve this loaded `SKILL.md`
with `Path(path).resolve()` before locating resources; follow symlinks. Bare
`helpers/`, `references/`, and template paths are relative to that real skill
directory. A path written as `skills/<name>/...` means the installed `<name>`
skill's directory from the agent's skill catalog, not a path in the user's project.
Locate each dependency by its public skill name; copied skills need not be siblings.
If a dependency is absent, report the missing skill and install it before that step.
Shared writing files are bundled in `how-to-write-ideas-report/references/`.

Before running the examples, set `DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR` to the absolute directory of `how-to-download-ref`. Quote these variables as shown.


# how-to-download-ref

## When to use

- A discussion / draft surfaces a paper not yet in the project KB, and you want it indexed for future search.
- The user says "add this ref to the KB", "download arXiv:XXXX", "pull this DOI".
- Bulk-importing a reading list from issue threads / chat history / a `references.bib`.

Do NOT use:
- For GitHub repos / web pages — those are too varied for a single-shot helper.

## Preflight (run once per machine)

Every helper runs under plain `python3`. Two of them want third-party packages:
`render.py` needs **pymupdf4llm** (highest-fidelity output, preserves figures) and
`scihub_download.py` needs **playwright**. Without them the renderer degrades to
`markitdown` → `pdftotext`, which is text-only — *figures missing, equations
mangled*. Verify before fetching:

```sh
python3 -c "import pymupdf4llm; print('ok', pymupdf4llm.__version__)"
```

If that errors, install it for the **same** `python3` the helpers will use:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user pymupdf4llm
# macOS / Homebrew, or any PEP 668 "externally managed" Python:
python3 -m pip install --user --break-system-packages pymupdf4llm
```

Both scripts also carry [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) inline
dependency metadata, so if you happen to have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/),
`uv run "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/render.py" ...` resolves those deps on its own and you can skip the
install step entirely. That is an option, not a requirement — the metadata is
inert comments to a plain interpreter.

**Tesseract is not needed for normal papers.** arXiv and APS PDFs are born-digital,
so `render.py` runs `pymupdf4llm` with `use_ocr=NEVER` and only retries with OCR
when a PDF turns out to have no text layer at all — a scanned old paper, usually
from the Sci-Hub tier. Install a language pack only if you hit that:
`tesseract-data-eng` (Arch), `tesseract-ocr-eng` (Debian/Ubuntu), or
`brew install tesseract-lang` (macOS).

On Arch in particular, *any* `tesseract-data-*` satisfies the `tessdata`
dependency, so it is easy to have `tesseract` installed with `eng` absent.

The Sci-Hub fallback (Step 4b) additionally needs a Chromium for Playwright to
clear the mirrors' DDoS-Guard challenge. Only required if you expect to hit
paywalled DOIs:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user playwright && python3 -m playwright install chromium
```

APS DOIs (`10.1103/*`) render from publisher JATS XML, which needs **pandoc**:

```sh
pandoc --version | head -1   # any 2.x/3.x works
```

If missing: `paru -S pandoc-cli` (Arch) / `apt install pandoc` / `brew install pandoc`.
Without it, APS refs silently fall back to the arXiv/PDF tiers.

For arXiv LaTeX sources (optional, Step 4 — only when the user opts in), `latexpand`
(ships with TeX Live) gives the cleanest flattening; if absent, a built-in Python
inliner is used — no action needed either way.

## Inputs

- **One or more arXiv IDs** (e.g. `1806.08734`, `2006.10739`) — strip the `vN` suffix.
- **One or more DOIs** (e.g. `10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.036401`) — lowercase preferred; renderer normalizes.
- **KB path** — see Step 1.

## Files this skill owns vs. doesn't

`how-to-download-ref` writes:
- `$KB/.raw/{arxiv,doi}/<id>.{json,pdf}`
- `$KB/.raw/doi/<safe-doi>.jats.xml` (publisher JATS for APS DOIs)
- `$KB/.raw/doi/<safe-doi>.aps.pdf` and `<safe-doi>-suppl/` (only with `--bagit`)
- `$KB/.raw/{arxiv,doi}/<id>-src/` (extracted e-print source tree — only when LaTeX sources requested)
- `$KB/.raw/{arxiv,doi}/<id>.tex` (flattened LaTeX; <safe-doi> filenames for DOI entries — only when LaTeX sources requested)
- `$KB/.figures/{arxiv__<id>,doi__<safe>}/...`
- `$KB/<id>_<slug>.md` (rendered paper, one per ref)
- `$KB/INDEX.md` (regenerated each run)
- Appends entries to `$KB/references.bib`

`how-to-download-ref` **never touches**:
- `$KB/NOTES.md` — owned by `survey` / `know-me-better` / humans (sub-themes, open problems, bottlenecks).

The canonical bib is `$KB/references.bib` — it lives inside the KB, beside `INDEX.md` and `NOTES.md`. (Older notes may say `$(dirname $KB)/ref.bib`; that project-root path is retired.)

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve the KB

If the caller passes `--kb <abs-path>`, use that. Otherwise:

```sh
KB=$(python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/resolve_kb.py")
if [ -z "$KB" ]; then
  # resolve_kb printed "unresolvable from ..." to stderr and exited 2.
  # Ask the user in chat where the KB should live.
  exit 1
fi
```

For advisor flows (`create-advisor`, `brainstorm-ideas` with a selected advisor), resolve the advisor KB instead: `KB=$(python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/resolve_kb.py" --advisor <slug>)`. This honors `$SCIBRAIN_KB_DIRNAME` the same way the project-KB form does.

### 2. Confirm the refs aren't already present

```sh
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/kb_identity.py" --kb "$KB" --arxiv 1806.08734
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/kb_identity.py" --kb "$KB" --doi 10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.036401
```

Exit 0 means `present <path> (matched via doi|arxiv)`, 1 means `missing`, and 2
means an invalid input or operational error. Skip present refs by default.
The fetch helper repeats this identity check, including within a batch; it never
creates another namespace for the same paper unless `--allow-duplicate` is set.
Requests using an entry's existing namespace still acquire missing assets; this
supports the survey handoff from abstract-only metadata to full-text rendering.
Rendering and bibliography appends also avoid identity duplicates.
To restore missing caches for existing entries, use **Regenerating a cloned KB** below.

### 3. Build a manifest

**3a. Direct input** (single-shot mode):

```sh
TMP=/tmp/how-to-download-ref-manifest.json
cat > "$TMP" <<'EOF'
{"arxiv": ["1806.08734", "2006.10739"], "doi": []}
EOF
```

**3b. From an existing `references.bib`** (bulk mode, `--from-bib`):

```sh
TMP=/tmp/how-to-download-ref-manifest.json
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/bibtex_to_manifest.py" "$KB/references.bib" > "$TMP"
```

When in bulk mode, optionally ask the user:

> "I see 59 refs in the manifest. Render all, topic-filtered, or specific IDs?"
> - **(a)** All — proceed with the full manifest
> - **(b)** Topic-filtered — name a heading from `NOTES.md` (skill greps for cite keys under it)
> - **(c)** Specific IDs — paste arXiv IDs / DOIs

For (b) and (c), edit `$TMP` accordingly before continuing.

### 4. Fetch metadata + arXiv PDFs

Ask the user whether they want LaTeX sources too:

> "Fetch arXiv LaTeX sources as full text for these refs?"
> - **(a)** PDF only (default) — bodies come from the PDF in Step 5.
> - **(b)** Also fetch LaTeX sources — Step 4 adds `--download-arxiv-source`, Step 5 adds `--tex-source`; refs with source render `full_text: latex`.

Default command (option **a**):

```sh
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/fetch_metadata.py" \
  --kb "$KB" \
  --manifest "$TMP" \
  --download-arxiv-pdfs
```

Option **(b)** adds the source fetch:

```sh
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/fetch_metadata.py" \
  --kb "$KB" \
  --manifest "$TMP" \
  --download-arxiv-pdfs \
  --download-arxiv-source
```

**APS DOIs are handled automatically.** For any `10.1103/*` DOI the helper first
calls the [APS Harvest API](https://harvest.aps.org/docs/harvest-api), which serves
the *publisher's own* JATS XML — real sections, MathML3 equations, a structured
reference list — with **no API key and no institutional IP**. This is ground truth
and strictly beats parsing the PDF. Coverage is per *article*, not per journal: you
get `ok` for gold-OA titles (PRX, PRX Quantum, PRResearch, PRAB, PRPER), SCOAP3
titles (PRC, PRD), and any individually CC-licensed article in PRL/PRA/PRB;
`closed` (HTTP 401) falls through to the arXiv and PDF tiers below. Pass `--no-aps`
to skip. The same request both tests access and delivers the text, so there is no
separate open-access lookup to do.

Metadata uses cached JSON, then Semantic Scholar batches of at most 500,
then Crossref for missing DOIs, including deposited metadata normalized to usable
BibTeX. PDF acquisition tries S2's OA URL, Unpaywall repository copies, then the
arXiv preprint. Pass `--email <contact-address>` or set `SCIBRAIN_CONTACT_EMAIL`
to enable Unpaywall and Crossref's polite pool; without an email, Unpaywall is
skipped. API errors and HTML landing pages fall through to the next source.
PDFs must have both a `%PDF` header and `%%EOF` trailer. A DOI miss continues to
Step 4b. Service contracts: [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/),
[Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/products/api).


`--download-arxiv-source` additionally fetches each arXiv paper's e-print
LaTeX source, extracts it to `.raw/arxiv/<id>-src/`, flattens
`\input`/`\include` into `.raw/arxiv/<id>.tex`, and copies the source tree's
figure files into `.figures/arxiv__<id>/`. `src-miss` lines (PDF-only
submissions, withdrawn papers, fetch failures) are fine — those refs fall
back to PDF rendering in Step 5. DOI entries whose Semantic Scholar record
names an arXiv preprint (`externalIds.ArXiv`) get the same treatment, into
`.raw/doi/<safe>.tex` and `.figures/doi__<safe>/`.

**Tip:** Set `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` in your environment to raise the Semantic Scholar rate limit from ~1 req/s to 100 req/s. Get a free key at https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key-form.

### 4b. Sci-Hub fallback for paywalled PDFs (script)

If Step 4 reports `miss` for any DOI (no open-access PDF and no arXiv preprint),
run the browser-based Sci-Hub helper. Pass the missed DOIs:

```sh
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/scihub_download.py" --kb "$KB" \
  --doi 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01693.x \
  --doi 10.3102/0034654316689306
```

It tries each mirror in `helpers/scihub_domains.toml` (in order) until one
serves the PDF, solving the mirrors' DDoS-Guard JavaScript challenge with a
headless browser, and saves to `$KB/.raw/doi/<safe>.pdf` (`<safe>` = DOI with
`/` → `-`) — the same place Step 4 writes, so Step 5 (render) picks it up. It
prints one `OK` / `MISS` / `SKIP` line per DOI.

- **Requires Playwright** (see Preflight). curl/urllib cannot pass DDoS-Guard.
- **Mirrors rotate.** If every DOI returns `MISS`, the domain list is likely
  stale: web-search "working sci-hub mirror domains <year>" and edit
  `helpers/scihub_domains.toml` (see its header), then re-run.
- If a stricter challenge blocks the headless browser, retry with `--headed`.

Skip this step if all PDFs were fetched in Step 4.

### 4c. APS extras (optional)

`aps_harvest.py` also runs standalone — useful for backfilling a KB built before
this path existed, or for pulling figures and supplemental material:

```sh
# probe one DOI without writing anything -> prints open | closed | notfound
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/aps_harvest.py" --check 10.1103/PhysRevB.108.045101

# backfill JATS for every APS DOI already in the KB
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/aps_harvest.py" --kb "$KB" --all

# ...and pull the BagIt package too: published PDF, figures, supplemental material
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/aps_harvest.py" --kb "$KB" --all --bagit
```

`--bagit` is the only way to get **supplemental material**, which the arXiv
preprint route cannot provide. It is much heavier (tens of MB per article), so
use it per-DOI rather than across a whole KB.

### 5. Render PDF to markdown

```sh
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/render.py" --kb "$KB"
```

Add `--only-missing` to skip papers that already have a rendered `.md` file (>500 bytes). This is much faster when adding a few papers to a large KB:

```sh
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/render.py" --kb "$KB" --only-missing
```

When the user opted into LaTeX sources (Step 4, option **b**), add `--tex-source`:

```sh
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/render.py" --kb "$KB" --tex-source
```

No manifest needed — renderer auto-discovers `.raw/{arxiv,doi}/*.json`. Renders new entries; overwrites existing.

**Body priority: JATS > LaTeX > PDF.** A `.jats.xml` in `.raw/doi/` always wins —
no flag needed — and renders `full_text: jats` plus a `## References` section built
from the publisher's structured reference list (every cited DOI/arXiv id included,
which is a citation graph for free). Below that,
`--tex-source` is the only switch that prefers a flattened `.tex` (arXiv entries, and DOI entries with an arXiv preprint) as
the full-text body (`full_text: latex` in frontmatter) — ground truth for
equations, read natively by agents. Without it, every ref renders from its
PDF, even when a `.tex` sits in `.raw/`. The PDF backends below apply to all
refs not rendered from LaTeX:

`.raw/` and `.figures/` should stay out of git. Append to `.gitignore` if missing.

### 6. Propose + confirm cite key (per ref, single-shot mode only)

In single-shot mode (Step 3a), ask the user to confirm each new cite key. In bulk mode (Step 3b), the keys come from `references.bib` directly — skip this step.

```sh
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/append_bibtex.py" propose \
  --kb "$KB" --id 1806.08734 --type arxiv --bib "$KB/references.bib"
```

Output JSON has `proposed_key` (form `lastname_year_firstkeyword`), `title`, `authors`, `year`, `bibtex_with_proposed_key`. With `--bib`, a key already present in the bib is disambiguated by walking to the next content word of the title (existing keys are never renamed). Show the user the proposed key and ask in chat:
- Accept the proposed key
- Use a custom key (free-text)
- Skip this entry

Once confirmed:

```sh
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/append_bibtex.py" append \
  --kb "$KB" --id 1806.08734 --type arxiv \
  --key rahaman_2018_spectral \
  --bib "$KB/references.bib"
```

The helper rewrites the BibTeX cite key, refuses duplicates, appends with one blank-line separator.

### 7. Regenerate INDEX.md

```sh
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/index.py" \
  --kb "$KB" \
  --title "<project-or-advisor-slug> — references" \
  --source-note "Reading list and full-text harness."
```

Replace `<project-or-advisor-slug>` with this KB's name. **Once chosen, keep `--title` and `--source-note` byte-identical across runs** — `INDEX.md` is regenerated wholesale every time; drift causes noisy diffs.

### 8. Verify and report

```sh
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/kb_doctor.py" --kb "$KB"
```

The offline checker reports named FAIL/WARN findings and exits nonzero for any
FAIL. It checks bibliography/Markdown correspondence, duplicate identities,
required frontmatter and field types, BibTeX fields, index membership, and orphan
caches. `full_text` accepts `jats`, `latex`, `yes`, or `no`.
Use `--checks duplicate-identity,index-sync` to select checks. `--fix` only repairs
INDEX.md, preserving its title, source note, and exclusions. Fix other findings
explicitly; the checker never merges or deletes references.

Tell the user the new cite keys, rendered paths, full-text status, and remaining findings.

## Regenerating a cloned KB

```sh
python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/kb_sync.py" --kb "$KB"
```

Requires `references.bib` and at least one rendered paper. This restores `.raw/`
and `.figures/` using each tracked entry's declared identifier namespace. Bib-only
references recover caches with a warning. It creates or rewrites no Markdown,
INDEX.md, or bibliography files. Complete caches need no network on repeat runs;
unavailable assets remain WARNs and can be retried. Invalid input or failed
restoration produces FAIL and a nonzero exit.

PDF figure restoration needs the same `pymupdf4llm` version used to render the
entry so filenames match tracked image links. Missing dependencies and mismatched
filenames are reported. LaTeX figures are restored from the cached source tree or
a new source download. Publisher JATS is restored for `full_text: jats` entries.
`--email` / `SCIBRAIN_CONTACT_EMAIL` enable Unpaywall here too.

## Human annotations

`note`, `tags`, and `rating` in existing frontmatter survive every render path,
including multiline values and lists. Generated metadata and body text refresh
from source. Keep other prose notes in NOTES.md.

## After download — continue to the survey report

After the done checklist passes, offer the pipeline's final stage:

> "Papers downloaded and rendered. Write the review?"
> - **(a)** Write a review — invoke `survey` in Survey Report mode to produce a technology assessment from the rendered KB.
> - **(b)** Done — stop here.

## Integration with other skills

- **`survey`** (upstream): writes/extends `$KB/NOTES.md`, appends to `$KB/references.bib`, regenerates `$KB/INDEX.md`, then hands off to `how-to-download-ref` to fetch PDFs and render full text. The survey's transition checkpoint offers this directly.
- **`survey` report mode** (downstream): consumes the rendered KB (full-text `.md` files + `$KB/references.bib`) to produce a structured technology assessment report.
- **`survey` / `know-me-better`**: write their own `.raw/` JSON via batched fetches and call `append_bibtex.py` directly (skipping the per-ref confirmation in Step 6). They invoke `index.py` at the end of their run.
- **`brainstorm-ideas` end-of-session**: surfaces candidate IDs/DOIs from the conversation; for the user's selections, invokes `how-to-download-ref` in single-shot mode.
- **`create-advisor`**: invokes `how-to-download-ref` (or `know-me-better`) targeting the advisor KB resolved by `python3 "$DOWNLOAD_REF_DIR/helpers/resolve_kb.py" --advisor <slug>`.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Passing a relative `--kb` | Always absolute. Helpers don't `cd`; figures depend on absolute paths. |
| Forgetting `--download-arxiv-pdfs` in Step 4 | Without it, refs with no LaTeX source render `full_text: no` — the PDF is the only body for DOIs and PDF-only arXiv submissions. |
| Using `arXiv:XXXX` with prefix or `vN` suffix | Strip both — manifest takes bare ids: `1806.08734`. |
| Editing generated body text and losing it on re-render | Keep prose in NOTES.md. Human frontmatter `note`, `tags`, and `rating` survives re-rendering. |
| Cite-key collision with different content | `append` skips silently. Propose with `--bib` so the key is disambiguated up front (next content word of the title). |
| Drifting `--title` / `--source-note` between runs | `INDEX.md` regenerates wholesale; first-run values are canonical. Copy verbatim from existing `INDEX.md`. |
| Expecting `.figures/` images for `full_text: latex` refs to come from the PDF | They come from the source tarball; PDF image extraction runs only on the PDF path. |
| Rendered from PDF despite a `.tex` in `.raw/` | PDF is the default. To use LaTeX bodies, pass `--tex-source` in Step 5 (and `--download-arxiv-source` in Step 4). |
| APS paper rendered from PDF, math mangled | `pandoc` is missing, or the article is genuinely `closed`. Check with `aps_harvest.py --check <doi>`. |
| Reaching for MinerU/Marker on an APS DOI | Try Harvest first — a 401 is the only thing that justifies parsing a PDF at all. |

## Done checklist

- [ ] `.raw/{arxiv,doi}/<id>.json` exists for every requested id
- [ ] `.raw/{arxiv,doi}/<id>.pdf` exists where the source allows (else recorded as miss)
- [ ] For every `10.1103/*` DOI: either `.raw/doi/<safe>.jats.xml` exists (`full_text: jats`) or the fetch logged `closed`
- [ ] One new `<id>_<slug>.md` per ref at `$KB/` root, with frontmatter
- [ ] `$KB/INDEX.md` regenerated, lists each new entry
- [ ] `$KB/references.bib` has the new cite key (no duplicate)
- [ ] User told cite keys, file names, and `full_text` latex/yes/no per ref
- [ ] If the user requested LaTeX sources: `.raw/arxiv/<id>.tex` exists for every arXiv id, and `.raw/doi/<safe>.tex` for every DOI with an arXiv preprint (or the `src-miss` reported)
