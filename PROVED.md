# Promoted Results

Only verifier-backed results may be promoted here. Each result must include its exact status label and its proof or certificate.

## P01 — no rank reduction by universally sound linear square-class sketches

**Status:** promoted.

**Verification record:** initial proof, focused hostile audit, and proof-blind end-to-end reconstruction all completed. No cross-family audit has run.

**Statement.** Let \(a_1,\ldots,a_m\) be positive integers with classes \(v_i=[a_i]\) in the \(\mathbb F_2\)-vector space \(\mathbb Q^\times/(\mathbb Q^\times)^2\). Let a homogeneous linear sketch choose \(e_i\in\mathbb F_2^d\). Suppose it is universally sound in the exact sense that

\[
\sum_i c_i e_i=0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\prod_i a_i^{c_i}\text{ is an integer square}
\]

for every \(c\in\mathbb F_2^m\). Then

\[
\operatorname{rank}(e_1,\ldots,e_m)
\ge
\operatorname{rank}(v_1,\ldots,v_m).
\]

In particular, if the \(a_i\) are distinct primes, then \(d\ge m\) and the sketch has no nonzero dependence.

**Proof.** Define \(E(c)=\sum_i c_i e_i\) and \(V(c)=\sum_i c_i v_i\). Positivity and unique factorization imply that \(V(c)=0\) exactly when \(\prod_i a_i^{c_i}\) is an integer square. Universal soundness is therefore \(\ker E\subseteq\ker V\). The map \(V\) factors through \(E\): define \(L(E(c))=V(c)\), which is well-defined by the kernel inclusion. Hence \(V=L\circ E\) and \(\operatorname{rank}V\le\operatorname{rank}E\). For distinct primes \(a_i=p_i\), taking the \(p_j\)-adic valuation modulo 2 in a relation shows each coefficient \(c_j=0\); thus \(\operatorname{rank}V=m\), forcing \(\operatorname{rank}E=m\), \(d\ge m\), and \(\ker E=0\). \(\square\)

**Scope.** This does not address lossy sketches followed by exact verification, randomized rejection, nonlinear or adaptive encodings, or special generators whose true square-class span is structurally small.

## P02 — factoring from a root of a hidden random unit square

**Status:** promoted.

**Verification record:** initial proof, focused hostile audit, and proof-blind end-to-end reconstruction all completed. No cross-family audit has run.

**Statement.** Let

\[
N=\prod_{j=1}^r p_j^{\alpha_j}
\]

be odd, with distinct primes \(p_j\). Choose hidden \(X\) uniformly in \((\mathbb Z/N\mathbb Z)^\times\), set \(A=X^2\), and give only \((N,A)\) to a routine whose private randomness is independent of \(X\). Conditional on the routine returning any valid root \(Y^2=A\),

\[
\Pr\bigl(1<\gcd(X-Y,N)<N\bigr)=1-2^{1-r}.
\]

Thus the probability is exactly \(1/2\) for a product of two distinct odd prime powers, at least \(1/2\) whenever \(r\ge2\), and zero for an odd prime power.

**Proof.** A unit square modulo an odd prime power has exactly two roots, since \(u^2=1\pmod {p^\alpha}\) implies \(p^\alpha\) divides one of the coprime-up-to-2 factors \(u-1,u+1\), hence \(u=\pm1\). CRT gives exactly \(2^r\) roots of \(A\), indexed by independent signs on the prime-power components. Conditional on \(A\) and on any returned \(Y\), the hidden \(X\) remains uniform among these roots because the routine sees no information about \(X\) beyond \(A\). If \(S\) is the set of components on which \(X=Y\), then

\[
\gcd(X-Y,N)=\prod_{j\in S}p_j^{\alpha_j};
\]

on every other component \(X-Y=-2Y\) is a unit. The gcd is proper and nontrivial for all sign subsets except the empty and full subsets. Exactly \(2^r-2\) of the \(2^r\) equiprobable choices succeed. \(\square\)

**Scope.** The unit, odd-modulus, root-validity, and hidden-root independence conditions are essential. This is a reduction, not a construction of an efficient square-root routine.

## P03 — synchronized collision products on one duplication-Lattès instance

**Status:** promoted.

**Verification record:** initial certificate, focused hostile audit, and proof-blind end-to-end reconstruction all completed. No cross-family audit has run.

**Statement.** Let \(R=\mathbb Z/15\mathbb Z\),

\[
E_{\mathrm{aff}}(R)=\{(x,y)\in R^2:y^2=x^3+2x+1\},
\]

and

\[
F(X)=\frac{X^4-4X^2-8X+4}{4(X^3+2X+1)}.
\]

For any \(P=(x_0,y_0)\in E_{\mathrm{aff}}(R)\), define \(x_{i+1}=F(x_i)\) by stepwise inversion. Every denominator is a unit, \(x_{i+3}=x_i\), and \(x_0,x_1,x_2\) have pairwise unit differences. Therefore

\[
D_m=\prod_{0\le i<j<m}(x_i-x_j)
\]

is a unit for \(1\le m\le3\) and is zero in \(R\) for \(m\ge4\). Every integer lift has gcd 1 or 15 with 15, respectively, and never produces a nontrivial factor.

**Proof.** The discriminant of the curve is \(-944\equiv1\pmod {15}\). Direct enumeration gives six affine points over each of \(\mathbb F_3\) and \(\mathbb F_5\), hence both elliptic-curve groups have prime order 7. The displayed rational function is the standard duplication formula

\[
x([2]P)=\left(\frac{3x^2+2}{2y}\right)^2-2x.
\]

Every affine local point consequently has order 7. Its doubling iterates remain nonidentity and cannot have \(y=0\), so every denominator \(4y^2\) is nonzero in both fields and hence a unit in \(R\). The multiplier classes \(1,2,4\) are distinct modulo sign in \(\mathbb Z/7\mathbb Z\), whereas \(2^3=1\pmod7\). Thus the first three local \(x\)-coordinates are pairwise distinct and the fourth repeats the first in both CRT components. Pairwise differences are units through \(m=3\), while \(x_0-x_3=0\) occurs in every \(D_m\) for \(m\ge4\). \(\square\)

**Scope.** This covers exactly the 36 affine CRT curve points for this fixed curve and modulus. It does not cover arbitrary residue seeds, randomized curves, or other dynamics. Indeed, for the same rational map the non-curve seed \(x=2\) gives \(2\to9\to7\pmod {15}\) and \(D_3=70\), whose gcd with 15 is 5.

## P04 — a Las Vegas splitter implies complete factorization

**Status:** promoted.

**Verification record:** initial proof, focused hostile audit with repairs, and proof-blind end-to-end reconstruction all completed. No cross-family audit has run.

**Statement.** Let \(\ell(x)=\lceil\log_2(x+1)\rceil\). Suppose one uniform classical randomized machine `Split` has the following guarantee on every composite \(M\): each invocation uses fresh random coins, halts almost surely, returns only \(d\) with \(1<d<M\) and \(d\mid M\), and has conditional expected bit cost at most a fixed nondecreasing polynomial \(Q(\ell(M))\). Let a uniform deterministic primality test have worst-case bit cost at most a fixed nondecreasing polynomial \(A(\ell(M))\). Then complete factorization is Las Vegas and, for \(n=\ell(N)\),

\[
\mathbb E[T(N)]
\le (n-2)Q(n)+(2n-3)A(n)+Kn^3
\]

for one fixed implementation constant \(K\).

**Algorithm.** Maintain a stack of unresolved occurrences, initially \([N]\), and a list of certified-prime occurrences. Primality-test each popped value. Move primes to the list; on a composite, call `Split`, verify the strict divisor and exact division, and replace it by the divisor and quotient. Sort and group the prime occurrences, verify their product, and output primes with multiplicities.

**Correctness and call bound.** At every state boundary, all stack/list occurrences are at least 2 and their product is \(N\). With \(k\) occurrences, \(2^k\le N<2^n\), hence \(k\le n-1\). A prime move preserves \(k\), while every split increases it by one. Starting from one occurrence gives at most \(n-2\) splits. Each split creates two tree nodes, so at most \(2n-3\) occurrences are primality-tested. This live invariant does not assume termination and counts repeated factors separately. When the stack empties, all leaves are certified prime and multiply to \(N\); grouping gives the unique complete factorization.

**Expected cost and termination.** Index the at most \(n-2\) possible split calls, assigning cost zero when a call is absent. Conditional on the full history before any reached call, its input is a fixed composite of at most \(n\) bits. Fresh coins and the conditional guarantee bound its expected cost by \(Q(n)\). The tower property and linearity give total expected split cost at most \((n-2)Q(n)\); mutual independence between different calls is unnecessary. The node bound gives deterministic primality cost \((2n-3)A(n)\). A finite union of the zero-probability nontermination events proves almost-sure termination. All stored values have at most \(n\) bits, and schoolbook validation, division, storage, sorting, grouping, product verification, and serialization cost at most \(Kn^3\). \(\square\)

**Scope.** Prime inputs use no split call; prime powers and repeated factors become repeated leaves; even and arbitrary composites are covered by the all-composite `Split` premise. Verification alone does not convert a fallible candidate generator: a separate inverse-polynomial success bound or direct polynomial expected-time guarantee is required.

## P05 — unequal local polynomial-gcd degrees expose a factor

**Status:** promoted.

**Verification record:** initial proof, focused hostile audit with convention/complexity repairs, and proof-blind end-to-end reconstruction all completed. No cross-family audit has run.

**Statement.** Let \(N=pq\) for distinct primes. Let densely represented \(A,B\in(\mathbb Z/N\mathbb Z)[X]\) have degrees at most \(D\) and unit leading coefficients. If their gcd degrees over \(\mathbb F_p\) and \(\mathbb F_q\) differ, a nontrivial factor of \(N\) is recoverable deterministically in \(\operatorname{poly}(D,\log N)\) bit operations.

**Proof.** Swap \(A,B\) so their degrees are \(m\ge n\). For \(0\le j<n\), let \(s_j\) be the determinant-form principal coefficient of the \(j\)-th subresultant. Over a field, if the gcd degree is \(d\), then \(s_j=0\) for \(j<d\) and \(s_d\ne0\). This follows from the Sylvester-map kernel: a common divisor of degree \(d\) gives a nonzero syzygy below index \(d\), while coprime cofactors and the strict degree bounds make the index-\(d\) map injective. If \(d_p\ne d_q\), take \(j=\min(d_p,d_q)<n\). Reduction of the determinant shows \(s_j\) is zero in exactly one CRT component, so \(\gcd(s_j,N)\) is a prime factor. Scanning all \(j\) finds it without knowing the local degrees. Each determinant has dimension at most \(2D\); a division-free Berkowitz circuit and modular reduction give, conservatively, \(O(D^5)\) ring operations and polynomial bit complexity. \(\square\)

**Scope.** This is conditional on efficiently constructing \(A,B\) with a local gcd-degree mismatch and on \(D=\operatorname{poly}(\log N)\).

## P06 — global-\(N\) powers can erase a genuine local cycle mismatch

**Status:** promoted.

**Verification record:** exact certificates passed focused hostile audit and proof-blind reconstruction. No cross-family audit has run.

**Certificate 1.** For \(N=15\), \(f=X^2+1\) is irreducible modulo 3, split squarefree modulo 5, and has unit resultant 4 with its derivative. Since \(X^2=-1\),

\[
X^{15^i}-X\equiv-2X\ (i\text{ odd}),
\qquad
X^{15^i}-X\equiv0\ (i\text{ even})
\pmod f
\]

in both CRT components, so the naive DDF profiles always agree. At \(i=1\), the true local differences \(X^3-X\) modulo 3 and \(X^5-X\) modulo 5 CRT-combine to \(10X\), whose coefficient exposes 5.

**Certificate 2.** For \(N=10\), \(f=X^2+9X+5\) is irreducible modulo 2, split squarefree modulo 5, and has unit resultant \(-61\). Modulo 2 the class of \(X\) has order 3 and \(10^i\equiv1\pmod3\); modulo 5, \(X^2=X\). Hence \(X^{10^i}-X=0\) in both components for every \(i\ge1\). The true local first differences combine to the constant 5.

**Scope.** These certificates refute only replacing component field-size powers by \(N^i\). Constructing the displayed true local CRT combinations directly uses the unknown components and is explanatory, not an algorithm or an impossibility theorem.

## P07 — the Jacobi-minus-one quadratic promise is restricted-semiprime factoring

**Status:** promoted.

**Verification record:** probability and both reduction directions passed focused hostile audit and proof-blind reconstruction. No cross-family audit has run.

**Statement.** Restrict inputs to \(N=pq\) for distinct odd primes and a monic quadratic with unit discriminant \(\Delta\) satisfying \((\Delta/N)=-1\). Producing a nontrivial factor on every such promise input is Las Vegas randomized-polynomial-time equivalent to factoring every distinct-odd-semiprime.

**Proof.** Factoring trivially solves the promise. Conversely, sample uniform monic quadratics. In each local field the discriminant is uniform; conditional on being nonzero, its square/nonsquare bit is fair. CRT makes the two bits independent. A valid negative-Jacobi unit therefore occurs per raw sample with probability \((p-1)(q-1)/(2pq)\), so its expected waiting time is \(2pq/((p-1)(q-1))\le15/4\). If a sampled discriminant has a proper gcd with \(N\), return it immediately; otherwise invoke the promise solver once the Jacobi symbol is \(-1\). All preprocessing is deterministic polynomial bit complexity, the loop terminates almost surely, and the promise solver's uniform expected-polynomial bound is preserved. \(\square\)

**Scope.** This covers neither prime squares nor unrestricted composites. It shows that recognizing/generating opposite local cycle signs does not perform the required separation; it does not rule out richer invariants of the polynomial.

## P08 — uniform linear gcd probes have exponentially small separation probability

**Status:** promoted.

**Verification record:** exact enumeration passed focused hostile audit and proof-blind reconstruction. No cross-family audit has run.

**Statement and proof.** Suppose a squarefree quadratic \(f\) splits modulo \(p\) and is irreducible modulo \(q\). For coefficientwise uniform \(B=aX+b\), the local gcd degree modulo \(p\) equals 2, 1, or 0 on respectively \(1\), \(2(p-1)\), or \((p-1)^2\) of the \(p^2\) coefficient pairs. Modulo \(q\), it equals 2 only for the zero polynomial and 0 otherwise. CRT independence gives

\[
\Pr(d_p\ne d_q)
=\frac{2p-1}{p^2}+\frac{p-2}{pq^2}
<\frac2p+\frac1{q^2}.
\]

Conditioning \(a\) to be a unit and normalizing \(B\) to \(X+t\) makes the exact probability \(2/p\). For balanced factors this is exponential in \(\log N\), so this probe strategy cannot have polynomial expected trials. \(\square\)
